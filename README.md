diagrams-input
==============

Parsing of various input formats. Raster images are handled with Juicy Pixels, svg images ared parsed with xml-conduit and attoparsec. The goal of the svg parser is to support all tags and features that are commonly used and that are supported by diagrams. For another excellent svg-parser, that is currently not targeted at `diagrams` see: [svg-tree] (https://github.com/Twinside/svg-tree).

Usage

See the diagrams manual: http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/doc/manual.html#images
